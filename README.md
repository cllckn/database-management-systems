# Database Management Systems

---

This course provides a **hands-on introduction to database management systems**, covering foundational 
concepts, data modeling, query languages, and practical implementation. Students will study both **relational and NoSQL 
database paradigms**, learning when and how each approach is applied in modern software systems. Through extensive 
practical exercises, students will design schemas, write queries, manipulate data, and work with multiple database 
technologies while following best practices in security, performance, and data management.

## Course Objectives

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

- Understand the fundamental principles, architecture, and components of database management systems.
- Design conceptual and logical data models using the Entity–Relationship (ER) model.
- Apply relational database concepts and write effective SQL queries.
- Explain the limitations of relational databases and the motivation for NoSQL systems.
- Select appropriate database technologies based on application requirements.
- Implement basic security and access control techniques.
