# **Final Project Assignment: Design and Implementation of a Relational Database System Using PostgreSQL**

## **Objective**

Within the scope of the project, you are required to develop a software application based on a
topic of your choice. While students are free to choose their project topic, it is expected that
the selected topic will differ from the comprehensive examples covered in class (e.g., e-commerce system and movie rental system).

The system must include a database design and implementation, as well as an application program that accesses
and utilizes the database. The application should include modules for performing straightforward Search, Insert, Delete,
and Update operations.

(Note: The application does not need to be complex. The evaluation will primarily focus on the database portion of the project.)


## **Project Requirements**

### **1. Database Design**
- Identify the **problem domain** and determine **business rules**.
- Design a **conceptual model** (ER diagram) and convert it into a **relational schema**.
- Ensure that **normalization principles** are applied to avoid redundancy.
- Use **Crowâ€™s Foot notation** for the ER diagram.

### **2. Database Implementation**
- Use **PostgreSQL** as the relational database management system (RDBMS).
- Implement the relational schema using **SQL DDL (Data Definition Language)**.
- Establish relationships (e.g., one-to-many, many-to-many) between tables to enforce data integrity.
- Load the database with sample data to validate the schema and test functionality.

### **3. Application Development**
- Develop an simple application using any of the following technologies:
    - **Programming Languages**: Java, Python, Node.js, C++, etc.
    - **Application Type**: Web, Desktop, Mobile, Terminal/Console-based
- The application must support the following operations:
    - **Searching for records**
    - **Inserting new records**
    - **Updating existing records**
    - **Deleting records**

### **4. Advanced Database Features**
- The database must include:
    - At least **15 tables**
    - At least **4 stored procedures or functions** (excluding triggers)
    - At least **4 triggers**
    - Use of **inheritance** (generalization) in the schema

## Evaluation Criteria
The assignment will be evaluated based on two primary components:

Project Implementation: The quality and effectiveness of the project you implement.

Oral Exam Performance: Your performance during the oral exam, which will take place during final exams(specific day and time to be announced later).

## Oral Exam Requirement

The oral exam is **mandatory** as part of the evaluation process.
Students will be assessed based on their understanding of the material presented in their **reports**
and **source code**.

### **During the Oral Exam:**
- Reports must be **open** and accessible.
- Source code must be **ready to show**.
- Applications must be **run** for demonstration.

## Group Work
Students may form groups of up to two members.

All group members will receive a common grade for the assignment.

Instructors may ask questions to any group member during the oral exam, so it is essential that every member understands all aspects of the project.
Therefore, each group member must be well-versed in every detail related to the project.

## Report Structure
While there is no standard template for the report, it must include the following essential components:

- **Cover Page**:
    - Student Information: Include your full name, student ID, course name, and date of submission.
    - Title of the Report: Clearly state the title of your project.
- **Introduction**: Overview of the project, business rules, and objectives.
- **ER Diagram (in Crow's Foot Notation)**: Designed using **draw.io**, **Lucidchart**, or similar tools.
- **Relational Schema**: Text-based representation of the database schema.
- **SQL Statements**: Scripts used to construct tables and insert data. You can generate it using export operation.
- **Stored Procedures & Triggers**: Explanation and SQL code.
- **Application Screenshots**: Demonstrating CRUD operations.
- **SQL Statements & Source Code**: Either embedded in the report or submitted as a **GitHub repository link**.

### Additional Recommendations

Ensure that your report is well-organized and free of grammatical errors.

Use clear headings and subheadings to enhance readability.

## Email Submission

Students are required to **compress** their reports, sql scripts, and source code into a **single file** (or provide a **GitHub link** for the code) and submit it via **email (cceken@ku.edu.kz)** before the **oral exam**.

* Email Subject: Use the following format for the subject line of your email:
    - dbms-final-project-StudentName
* File Naming: Ensure that the compressed file is named appropriately, using the following format:
    - StudentName-Report.zip
* Only **one submission per group** is sufficient.

## Technology Requirements
Students are **required** to use the following technologies for their project:

- **PostgreSQL** for database management **(mandatory)**.
- **Any programming language (Java, Python, Node.js, C++, etc.)** for interfaces.
- **SQL and PL/pgSQL** for database implementation.


### By adhering to these guidelines and policies, you will ensure that your submission is complete and meets the evaluation criteria. Good luck with your projects and oral exams!
