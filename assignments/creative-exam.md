# **Final Project Assignment: Design and Implementation of a Relational Database System Using PostgreSQL**

## **Objective**

Within the scope of this project, you are required to develop a software application based on your assigned topic. The system must incorporate a well-structured database design and implementation, along with an application that connects to and utilizes the database effectively.

The application should allow users to perform basic data operations, including Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD). While application functionality is important, the primary focus will be on the design, implementation, and use of advanced database features.

The application does not need to be complex — the evaluation will primarily focus on the database aspect of the project.

## **Project Requirements**

**Database Design**
* Clearly define the problem domain based on the assigned topic.
* Identify business rules and key entities.
* Design a conceptual model (ER diagram) using Crow’s Foot notation.
* Convert the ER model into a relational schema.
* The database must include at least 10 tables.

**Database Implementation (PostgreSQL)**
* Implement the relational schema using PostgreSQL.
* Define primary keys, foreign keys, and constraints to enforce integrity.
* Populate the database with sample data to demonstrate functionality.

**Application Development**
* Build a simple application to interact with the database using any of the following technologies:
  * Languages: Java, Python, Node.js, C++, etc.
  * Application types: Web, Desktop, Console, or Mobile
* The application must support CRUD operations on at least one table:

**Advanced Database Features**
* The database must include:
* At least 4 stored procedures or functions (not including triggers)
* At least 4 triggers to automate database logic

**Indexing and Performance Analysis**
* Define at least one index (e.g., B-tree index) on a frequently queried column.
* Write and execute queries with and without the index.
* Provide a comparative performance analysis using PostgreSQL's EXPLAIN ANALYZE.
  * Include screenshots or statistics showing query plan, cost, and execution time.
